DEPENDENCIES

Install the following packages to be able to build atop:

* zlib-devel     or  libz-dev          (depending on the distribution)
* ncurses-devel  or  libncurses5-dev   (depending on the distribution)

Install the following packages to be able to run atop:

* zlib
* ncurses


INSTALLING AND USING ATOP

For interactive use, it is sufficient to install ATOP with the command
(as root):

	make systemdinstall

		or

	make sysvinstall

For automatic logging in compressed binary format, see the
description in the manual-page.

The kernel module 'netatop' can be downloaded and installed separately
from www.atoptool.nl/downloadnetatop.php
This module is optional and can be used to gather network statistics
per process/thread as described in www.atoptool.nl/netatop.php


KERNEL ISSUES WITH PROCESS ACCOUNTING
-------------------------------------

Newer upstream kernels (e.g. 4.8 and 4.9)have two issuess
with process accounting:

1) Sometimes process accounting does not work at all¹. Atopacctd tries to
work around this issue, by retrying to initialize process accounting
several times.

2) When using the NETLINK inface, the command TASKSTATS_CMD_GET
consequently returns -EINVAL². Atopacctd needs NETLINK to be able to
be triggered that some process in the system has finished. In this way,
atopacctd can be in a blocking state as long as no processes terminate.
When atopacctd detects that NETLINK fails, it switches into a polling
mode to periodically try if it can read process accounting records as
a workaround. This issue has to do with cpumasks and you can work-around
it by building a kernel that has CONFIG_NR_CPUS configured to exactly
the amount of CPUs (logical CPUs) in the system the kernel runs on. You
can find this kernel option under "Processor type and features" -->
"Maximum number of CPUs".
