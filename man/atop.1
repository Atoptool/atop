.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.I atop
is an interactive monitor to view the load on a Linux system.
It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources 
(from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk
and network.
.br
It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated
load with respect to cpu and memory load on process level.
Disk load is shown per process if "storage accounting" is active in the kernel.
Network load is shown per process if the kernel module `netatop'
has been installed.
.PP
The initial screen shows if
.I atop
runs with restricted view (unprivileged) or unrestricted view (privileged).
In case of restricted view
.I atop
does not have the privileges (root identity or necessary capabilities) to
retrieve all counter values on system level and on process level.
.PP
Every
.I interval
(default: 10 seconds) information is shown about the resource occupation
on system level (cpu, memory, disks and network layers), followed
by a list of processes which have been active during the last interval
(note that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval
are not shown, unless the key 'a' has been pressed or unless sorting on
memory occupation is done).
If the list of active processes does not entirely fit on
the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted in order of activity).
.br
The intervals are repeated till the number of
.I samples
(specified as command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed
in interactive mode.
.PP
When 
.I atop
is started, it checks whether the standard output channel is connected to a
screen, or to a file/pipe. In the first case it produces screen control 
codes (via the ncurses library) and behaves interactively; in the second case
it produces flat ASCII-output.
.PP
In interactive mode, the output of 
.I atop
scales dynamically to the current dimensions of the screen/window.
.br
If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed
automatically. For this purpose, every column has a particular weight. The
columns with the highest weights that fit within the current width will
be shown.
.br
If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread list 
will be added or removed automatically.
.PP
Furthermore in interactive mode the output of 
.I atop
can be controlled by pressing particular keys.
However it is also possible to specify such key as
.B flag
on the command line. In that case
.I atop
switches to the indicated mode on beforehand; this mode can 
be modified again interactively. Specifying such key as flag is especially
useful when running
.I atop
with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively).
These flags are the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive
mode (see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
.br
Additional flags are available to support storage of atop-data in raw 
format (see section RAW DATA STORAGE).
.SH PROCESS ACCOUNTING
With every interval,
.I atop
reads the kernel administration to obtain information about all
running processes.
However, it is likely that during the interval also processes have terminated.
These processes might have consumed system resources during
this interval as well before they terminated.
Therefore,
.I atop
tries to read the process accounting records that contain the accounting
information of terminated processes and report these processes too.
Only when the process accounting mechanism in the kernel is activated,
the kernel writes such process accounting record to a file
for every process that terminates.
.PP
There are various ways for
.I atop
to get access to the process accounting records (tried in this order):
.PP
.TP 4
1.
When the environment variable ATOPACCT is set,
it specifies the name of the process accounting file.
In that case, process accounting for this file
should have been activated on beforehand.
Before opening this file for reading,
.I atop
drops its root privileges (if any).
.br
When this environment variable is present but its
contents is empty, process accounting will not be used at all.
.PP
.TP 4
2.
.B This is the preferred way of handling process accounting records!
.br
When the
.I atopacctd
daemon is active, it has activated the process accounting mechanism in
the kernel and transfers to original accounting records to shadow files.
In that case,
.I atop
drops its root privileges and opens the current shadow file for reading.
.br
This way is preferred, because the
.I atopacctd
daemon maintains full control of the size of the original process
accounting file written by the kernel and the shadow files read by the
.I atop
process(es).

The
.I atopacct
service will be activated before the
.I atop
service to enable
.I atop
to detect that process accounting is managed by the
.I atopacctd
daemon. As a forking service, 
.I atopacctd
takes care that all directories and files are initialized before the
parent process dies. The child process continues as the daemon process.

For further information, refer to the
.B atopacctd
man page.
.PP
.TP 4
3.
When the
.I atopacctd
daemon is not active, 
.I atop
verifies if the process accounting mechanism has been switched on
via the separate
.B psacct
or
.B acct
package (the package name depends on the Linux distro). In that case,
one of the files
.B /var/log/pacct,
.B /var/account/pacct
or
.B /var/log/account/pacct
is in use as process accounting file and 
.I atop
opens this file for reading.
.PP
.TP 4
4.
As a last possibility,
.I atop
itself tries to activate the process accounting mechanism (requires root
privileges) using the file
.B /var/cache/atop.d/atop.acct
(to be written by the kernel, to be read by
.I atop
itself). Process accounting remains active as long as
at least one
.I atop
process is alive.
Whenever the last
.I atop
process stops (either by pressing `q' or by `kill \-15'), it deactivates the
process accounting mechanism again. Therefore you should never terminate
.I atop
by `kill \-9', because then it has no chance to stop process accounting.
As a result, the accounting file may consume a lot of 
disk space after a while.
.br
To avoid that the process accounting file consumes too much disk space,
.I atop
verifies at the end of every sample if the size of the process accounting
file exceeds 200 MiB and if this
.I atop
process is the only one that is currently using the file.
In that case the file is truncated to a size of zero.

Notice that root-privileges are required to switch on/off process accounting
in the kernel. You can start
.I atop
as a root user or specify setuid-root privileges to the executable file.
In the latter case,
.I atop
switches on process accounting and drops the root-privileges again.
.br
If
.I atop
does not run with root-privileges, it does not show information
about finished processes.
It indicates this situation with the message
message `no procacct` in the top-right corner (instead of the counter that
shows the number of exited processes).
.PP
When during one interval a lot of processes have finished,
.I atop
might grow tremendously in memory when reading all process accounting
records at the end of the interval. To avoid such excessive growth,
.I atop
will never read more than 50 MiB with process information from the
process accounting file per interval (approx. 70000 finished processes).
In interactive mode a warning is given whenever processes have been skipped
for this reason.
.PP
.SH COLORS
For the resource consumption on system level,
.I atop
uses colors to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has
been (almost) reached. 
A critical occupation percentage means that is likely that this load
causes a noticeable negative performance influence for applications using
this resource. The critical percentage depends on the type of resource:
e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a busy percentage of 80%
might be more noticeable for applications/user than a CPU with a busy
percentage of 90%.
.br
Currently
.I atop
uses the following default values to calculate a weighted percentage
per resource:
.PP
.TP 5
.B \ Processor
A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered `critical'.
.TP 5
.B \ Disk
A busy percentage of 70% or higher is considered `critical'.
.TP 5
.B \ Network
A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an interface is
considered `critical'.
.TP 5
.B \ Memory
An occupation percentage of 90% is considered `critical'.
Notice that this occupation percentage is the accumulated memory
consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the
memory for the page cache (`cache' and `buff' in the MEM-line) and the
reclaimable part of the slab (`slrec`) is not implied!
.br
If the number of pages swapped out (`swout' in the PAG-line) is larger
than 10 per second, the memory resource is considered `critical'.
A value of at least 1 per second is considered `almost critical'.
.br
If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit (`vmcom' and `vmlim'
in the SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the system.
.TP 5
.B \ Swap
An occupation percentage of 80% is considered `critical'
because swap space might be completely exhausted in the near future;
it is not critical from a performance point-of-view.
.PP
These default values can be modified in the configuration file
(see separate man-page of atoprc).
.PP
When a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning
values in the screen line are colored red by default.
.br
When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical percentage
(so it is almost critical), the concerning values in the screen line
are colored cyan by default. This `almost critical percentage' (one value
for all resources) can be modified in the configuration file
(see separate man-page of atoprc).
.br
The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file
as well (see separate man-page of atoprc).
.PP
With the key 'x' (or flag \-x), the use of colors can be suppressed.
.SH NETATOP MODULE
Per-process and per-thread network activity can be measured by the
.I netatop
kernel module. You can download this kernel module from the website
(mentioned at the end of this manual page) and install it on your
system if the kernel version is 2.6.24 or newer.
.br
When
.I atop
gathers counters for a new interval, it verifies if the
.I netatop
module is currently active. If so,
.I atop
obtains the relevant network counters from this module and shows
the number of sent and received packets per process/thread in the generic
screen. Besides, detailed counters can be requested by
pressing the `n' key.
.br
When the
.I netatopd
daemon is running as well,
.I atop
also reads the network counters of exited processes that are logged
by this daemon (comparable with process accounting).
.PP
More information about the optional
.I netatop
kernel module and the
.I netatopd
daemon can be found in the concerning man-pages and on the website
mentioned at the end of this manual page.
.SH GPU STATISTICS GATHERING
GPU statistics can be gathered by
.I atopgpud
which is a separate data collection daemon process.
It gathers cumulative utilization counters of every Nvidia GPU
in the system, as well as utilization counters of every 
process that uses a GPU.
When
.I atop
notices that the daemon is active, it reads these GPU utilization
counters with every interval.

The
.I atopgpud
daemon is written in Python, so a Python interpreter should be installed
on the target system. The Python code of the daemon is compatible with
Python version 2 and version 3.
For the gathering of the statistics, the
.I pynvml
module is used by the daemon. Be sure that this module is installed
on the target system before activating the daemon, by running the
command as root
.I pip
(the command
.I pip
might be exchanged by
.I pip3
in case of Python3):
.PP
.B \  pip install nvidia-ml-py
.PP
The
.I atopgpud
daemon is installed by default as part of the
.B atop
package, but it is 
.I not
automatically enabled.
The daemon can be enabled and started now by running the following commands
(as root):
.PP
.B \  systemctl enable atopgpu
.br
.B \  systemctl start  atopgpu
.PP
Find a description about the utilization counters in the section OUTPUT DESCRIPTION.
.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
When running
.I atop
interactively (no output redirection), keys can be pressed to control the
output. In general, lower case keys can be used to show other information for
the active processes and upper case keys can be used to influence the
sort order of the active process/thread list.
.PP
.TP 5
.B g
Show generic output (default).

Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, cpu consumption during
the last interval in system and user mode, the virtual and resident
memory growth of the process.

The subsequent columns depend on the used kernel:
.br
When the kernel supports "storage accounting" (>= 2.6.20), the data
transfer for read/write on disk, the status and exit code are
shown for each process.
When the kernel does not support
"storage accounting", the username, number of threads in the
thread group, the status and exit code are shown.
.br
When the kernel module 'netatop' is loaded, the data transfer for send/receive
of network packets is shown for each process.
.br
The last columns contain the state, the occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the process name.

When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

of 80 positions:
process-id, minor and major
memory faults, size of virtual shared text, total virtual 
process size, total resident process size, virtual and resident growth during
last interval, memory occupation percentage and process name.

When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

For memory consumption, always all processes are shown (also the processes
that were not active during the interval).
.PP
.TP 5
.B d
Show disk-related output.

When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel, the following
fields are shown:
process-id, amount of data read from disk, amount of data written to disk,
amount of data that was written but has been withdrawn again (WCANCL),
disk occupation percentage and process name.
.PP
.TP 5
.B n
Show network related output.

Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, thread-id,
total bandwidth for received packets,
total bandwidth for sent packets,
number of received TCP packets with the average size per packet (in bytes),
number of sent TCP packets with the average size per packet (in bytes),
number of received UDP packets with the average size per packet (in bytes),
number of sent UDP packets with the average size per packet (in bytes),
the network occupation percentage and process name.
.br
This information can only be shown when kernel module `netatop' is installed.

When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
.PP
.TP 5
.B s
Show scheduling characteristics.

Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id,
number of threads in state 'running' (R),
number of threads in state 'interruptible sleeping' (S),

Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window-width
of 80 positions:
process-id, user name and group,
start date and time, status (e.g. exit code if the process has finished),
state, the occupation percentage for the chosen resource and the process name.

When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.
.PP
.TP 5
.B c
Show the command line of the process.

Per process the following fields are shown: process-id,
the occupation percentage for the chosen resource and the
command line including arguments.
.PP
.TP 5
.B X
Show cgroup v2 information.

Per process the following fields are shown:
process-id,
`cpu.weight' of the cgroup the process belongs to,
`cpu.max' value (recalculated as percentage) of the cgroup the process belongs to,
most restrictive `cpu.max' value found in the upper directories,
`memory.max' value of the cgroup the process belongs to,
most restrictive `memory.max' value found in the upper directories,
`memory.swap.max' value of the cgroup the process belongs to,
most restrictive `memory.swap.max' value found in the upper directories,
the command name, and
the cgroup path name (horizontally scrollable).
.PP

Per process at least the following fields are shown:
process-id,
range of GPU numbers on which the process currently runs,
GPU busy percentage on all GPUs,
memory busy percentage (i.e. read and write accesses on memory) on all GPUs,
memory occupation at the moment of the sample,
average memory occupation during the sample, and
GPU percentage.

When the
.I atopgpud
daemon does not run with root privileges, the GPU busy percentage and
the memory busy percentage are not available on process level.
In that case, the GPU percentage on process level reflects the
GPU memory occupation instead of the GPU busy percentage (which
is preferred).
.PP
.TP 5
.B o
Show the user-defined line of the process.

In the configuration file the keyword
.I ownprocline
can be specified with the description of a user-defined output-line.
.br
Refer to the man-page of
.B atoprc
for a detailed description.
.PP
.TP 5
.B y
Show the individual threads within a process (toggle).

Single-threaded processes are still shown as one line.
.br
For multi-threaded processes, one line represents the process
while additional lines show the activity
per individual thread (in a different color). Depending on
the option 'a' (all or active toggle), all threads are shown
or only the threads that were active during the last interval.
Depending on the option 'Y' (sort threads), the threads per
process will be sorted on the chosen sort criterium or not.
.br
Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.
.PP
.TP 5
.B Y
Sort the threads per process when combined with option 'y' (toggle).
.PP
.TP 5
.B u
Show the process activity accumulated per user.

Per user the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a'). 
.br
When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
When the kernel module `netatop' has been installed,
the number of received and sent network packets are shown.
.br
The last columns contain the accumulated occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the user name.
.PP
.TP 5
.B p
Show the process activity accumulated per program (i.e. process name).

Per program the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a'). 
.br
When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
When the kernel module `netatop' has been installed,
the number of received and sent network packets are shown.
.br
The last columns contain the accumulated occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the program name.
.PP
.TP 5
.B j
Show the process activity accumulated per Docker container.

Per container the following fields are shown: number of processes active
or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command `a'),
accumulated cpu consumption during last interval in system and user mode,
the current virtual and resident memory space consumed by active processes
(or all processes of the user if combined with command `a'). 
.br
When "storage accounting" is active in the kernel,
the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
When the kernel module `netatop' has been installed,
the number of received and sent network packets are shown.
.br
The last columns contain the accumulated occupation percentage for the
chosen resource (default: cpu) and the Docker container id (CID).
.PP
.TP 5
.B C 
Sort the current list in the order of cpu consumption (default).
The one-but-last column changes to ``CPU''.
.PP
.TP 5
.B E
Sort the current list in the order of GPU utilization
(preferred, but only applicable
when the
.I atopgpud
daemon runs under root privileges) or the order of
GPU memory occupation).
The one-but-last column changes to ``GPU''.
.PP
.TP 5
.B M 
Sort the current list in the order of resident memory consumption.
The one-but-last column changes to ``MEM''. In case of sorting on memory,
the full process list will be shown (not only the active processes).
.PP
.TP 5
.B D
Sort the current list in the order of disk accesses issued.
The one-but-last column changes to ``DSK''.
.PP
.TP 5
.B N
Sort the current list in the order of network bandwidth (received
and transmitted).
The one-but-last column changes to ``NET''.
.PP
.TP 5
.B A
Sort the current list automatically in the order of the most busy
system resource during this interval.
The one-but-last column shows either ``ACPU'', ``AMEM'', ``ADSK'' or ``ANET''
(the preceding 'A' indicates automatic sorting-order).
The most busy resource is determined by comparing the weighted
busy-percentages of the system resources, as described earlier in
the section COLORS.
.br
This option remains valid until
another sorting-order is explicitly selected again.
.br
A sorting-order for disk is only possible when "storage accounting" is active.
A sorting-order for network is only possible when the kernel module `netatop'
is loaded.
.PP
Miscellaneous interactive commands:
.PP
.TP 5
.B ?
Request for help information (also the key 'h' can be pressed).
.PP
.TP 5
.B V
Request for version information (version number and date).
.PP
.TP 5
.B R
Gather and calculate the proportional set size of processes (toggle).
Gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE of a process
is a very time-consuming task, so this key should only be active when
analyzing the resident memory consumption of processes.
.PP
.TP 5
.B W
Get the WCHAN per thread (toggle).
Gathering of the WCHAN string per thread
is a relatively time-consuming task, so this key should only be made
active when analyzing the reason for threads to be in sleep state.
.PP
.TP 5
.B x
Suppress colors to highlight critical resources (toggle).
.br
Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.
.PP
.TP 5
.B z
The pause key can be used to freeze the current situation in order to
investigate the output on the screen. While 
.I atop
is paused, the keys described above can be pressed to show other
information about the current list of processes.
Whenever the pause key is pressed again,
atop will continue with a next sample.
.PP
.TP 5
.B i
Modify the interval timer (default: 10 seconds). If an interval timer of 0 is
entered, the interval timer is switched off. In that case a new sample can
only be triggered manually by pressing the key 't'.
.PP
.TP 5
.B t
Trigger a new sample manually. This key can be pressed if the current sample
should be finished before the timer has exceeded, or if no timer is set at all
(interval timer defined as 0). In the latter case
.I atop
can be used as a stopwatch to measure the load being caused by a
particular application transaction, without knowing on beforehand how many
seconds this transaction will last.

When viewing the contents of a raw file this key can be used to show the
next sample from the file. This key can also be used when viewing raw data
via a pipe.
.PP
.TP 5
.B T
When viewing the contents of a raw file this key can be used to show the
previous sample from the file, however not when reading raw data from a pipe.
.PP
.TP 5
.B b
When viewing the contents of a raw file, this key can be used to branch
to a certain timestamp within the file either forward or backward.
When viewing raw data from a pipe only forward branches are possible.
.PP
.TP 5
.B r
Reset all counters to zero to see the system and process activity since
boot again.

When viewing the contents of a raw file, this key can be used to rewind
to the beginning of the file again (except when reading raw data from a pipe).
.PP
.TP 5
.B U
Specify a search string for specific user names as a regular expression.
From now on, only (active) processes will be shown from a user which matches
the regular expression.

By default lines are shown of all CPUs, disks and network interfaces
which have been active during the last interval.
Limiting these lines can be useful on systems with huge number CPUs,
disks or interfaces in order to be able to run
.I atop
on a screen/window with e.g. only 24 lines.
.br
For all mentioned resources the maximum number of lines can be specified
interactively. When using the flag
.B -l
the maximum number of per-cpu lines is set to 0,
the maximum number of disk lines to 5 and
the maximum number of interface lines to 3.

.SH RAW DATA STORAGE
In order to store system and process level statistics for long-term
analysis (e.g. to check the system load and the active processes running
yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00 PM),
.I atop
can store the system and process level statistics in
compressed binary format in a raw file with the flag
.B -w
followed by the filename.
If this file already exists and is recognized as a raw data file,
.I atop
will append new samples to the file (starting with a sample which reflects
the activity since boot); if the file does not exist, it will be created.
.br
All information about processes and threads is stored in the raw file. 
.br
The interval (default: 10 seconds) and number of samples (default: infinite)
can be passed as last arguments. Instead of the number of samples, the flag
.B -S
can be used to indicate that
.I atop
should finish anyhow before midnight.
.PP
A raw file can be read and visualized again with the flag
.B -r
followed by the filename. If no filename is specified, the file
.BI /var/log/atop/atop_ YYYYMMDD
is opened for input (where
.I YYYYMMDD
are digits representing the current date).
If a filename is specified in the format YYYYMMDD (representing any valid
date), the file
.BI /var/log/atop/atop_ YYYYMMDD
is opened.
If a filename with the symbolic name
.BI y
is specified, yesterday's daily logfile is opened
(this can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days ago). 
If the filename
.BI -
is used, stdin will be read.
.br
The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by using the key 't'
to show the next sample, the key 'T' to show the previous sample, the
key 'b' to branch to a particular time or the key 'r' to rewind to
the begin of the file.
.br
When output is redirected to a file or pipe,
.B atop
prints all samples in plain ASCII. The default line length is 80 characters
in that case; with the flag
.B -L
followed by an alternate line length, more (or less) columns will be shown.
.br
With the flag
.B -b
(begin time) and/or
.B -e
(end time) followed by a time argument of the form [YYYYMMDD]hhmm,
a certain time period within the raw file can be selected.
.PP
Every day at midnight
.B atop
is restarted by the
.BI atop-rotate.timer
and
.BI atop-rotate.service
unit files, to write compressed binary data to the file
.BI /var/log/atop/atop_ YYYYMMDD
with an interval of 10 minutes by default.
.br
Furthermore all raw files are removed that are older than 28 days
(by default).
.br
The mentioned default values can be overruled in the file
.B /etc/default/atop
that might contain other values for
.B LOGOPTS
(by default without any flag),
.B LOGINTERVAL
(in seconds, by default 600),
.B LOGGENERATIONS
(in days, by default 28), and
.B LOGPATH
(directory in which logfiles are stored).
.PP
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep the format of the raw files
compatible in newer versions of
.B atop
especially when lots of new counters have to be maintained.
Therefore, the program
.B atopconvert
is installed to convert a raw file created by an older
version of
.B atop
to a raw file that can be read by a newer version of
.B atop
(see the man page of
.B atopconvert
for more details).

.SH OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
The first sample shows the system level activity since boot
(the elapsed time in the header shows the time since boot).
Note that particular counters could have reached their maximum
value (several times) and started by zero again,
so do not rely on these figures.
.PP
For every sample
.I atop
first shows the lines related to system level activity. If a particular 
system resource has not been used during the interval, the entire line
related to this resource is suppressed. So the number of system level lines
may vary for each sample.
.br
After that a list is shown of processes which have been active during the last
interval. This list is by default sorted on cpu consumption, but this order
can be changed by the keys which are previously described.
.PP
If values have to be shown by
.I atop
which do not fit in the column width,
another format is used. If e.g. a cpu-consumption of 233216 milliseconds
should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as `233s'
(in seconds).
For large memory figures, another unit is chosen if the value does not fit
(Mb instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, ...).
For other values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789
shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).
.SH OUTPUT DESCRIPTION - SYSTEM LEVEL
The system level information consists of the following output lines:
.PP
.TP 5
.B PRC
Process and thread level totals.
.br
This line contains the total cpu time consumed 
in system mode (`sys') and in user mode (`user'),
the total number of processes present at this moment (`#proc'),
the total number of threads present at this moment in state `running' (`#trun'),
`sleeping interruptible' (`#tslpi') and `sleeping uninterruptible' (`#tslpu'),
the number of zombie processes (`#zombie'),
the number of clone system calls (`clones'), and
the number of processes that ended during the interval
(`#exit') when process accounting is used. Instead of `#exit` the last
column may indicate that process accounting could not be activated
(`no procacct`).
.br
If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters,
only a relevant subset is shown.
.PP
.TP 5
.B CPU
CPU utilization.
.br
At least one line is shown for the total occupation of all CPUs together.
.br
In case of a multi-processor system, an additional line is shown
for every individual processor (with `cpu' in lower case),
sorted on activity. Inactive CPUs will not be shown by default.
The lines showing the per-cpu occupation contain the cpu number in
the field combined with the wait percentage.

Every line contains the percentage of cpu time spent in 
kernel mode by all active processes (`sys'), 
the percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (`user') for all
active processes (including processes running with a nice value larger than
zero), the percentage of cpu time spent for interrupt handling (`irq')
including softirq, the percentage of unused cpu time while no processes
were waiting for disk I/O (`idle'), and
the percentage of unused cpu time while at least one process was waiting
for disk I/O (`wait').
.br
In case of per-cpu occupation, the cpu number and
the wait percentage (`w') for that cpu.
The number of lines showing the per-cpu occupation can be limited.

For virtual machines, the steal-percentage (`steal') shows 
the percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines
running on the same hardware.
.br
For physical machines hosting one or more virtual machines,
the guest-percentage (`guest') shows 
the percentage of cpu time used by the virtual machines. Notice that
this percentage overlaps the user percentage!

When PMC performance monitoring counters are supported by the CPU
and the kernel (and
.I atop
runs with root privileges), the number of instructions per
CPU cycle (`ipc') is shown.
The first sample always shows the value 'initial',
because the counters are just activated at the moment that
.I atop
is started.
.br
When the
.I CPU busy percentage is high
and the IPC is less than 1.0,
it is likely that the CPU is frequently waiting for memory access
during instruction execution (larger CPU caches or faster memory might
be helpful to improve performance).
When the
.I CPU busy percentage is high
and the IPC is greater than 1.0,
it is likely that the CPU is instruction-bound (more/faster cores
might be helpful to improve performance).
.br
Furthermore, per CPU the effective number of cycles (`cycl') is shown.
This value can reach the current CPU frequency if such CPU is 100% busy.
When an idle CPU is halted, the number of effective cycles can
be (considerably) lower than the current frequency.
.br
Notice that the
.I average
instructions per cycle and number of cycles is shown in the CPU line
for all CPUs.
.br
Beware that reading the cycle counter in virtual machines (guests) might
introduce performance delays. Therefore this metric is by default disabled
in virtual machines. However, with the keyword 'perfevents' in the atoprc file
this metric can be explicitly set to 'enable' or 'disable'
(see separate man-page of atoprc).
.br

In case of frequency scaling, all previously mentioned CPU percentages
are relative to the used scaling of the CPU during the interval.
If a CPU has been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during the interval
while the frequency scaling of that CPU was 40%, only 20% of the full
capacity of the CPU has been used in user mode.
.br
In case that the kernel module `cpufreq_stats' is active
(after issuing `modprobe cpufreq_stats'), the
.I average
frequency (`avgf') and the
.I average
scaling percentage (`avgscal') is shown. Otherwise the
.I current
frequency (`curf') and the
.I current
scaling percentage (`curscal') is shown at the moment that the sample
is taken.
Notice that
.I average
values for frequency and scaling are shown in the CPU line for every CPU.
.br
Frequency scaling statistics are only gathered for systems
with maximum 8 CPUs, since gathering of these values per CPU
is very time consuming.

If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters,
only a relevant subset is shown.
.PP
.TP 5
.B CPL
CPU load information.
.br
This line contains the load average figures reflecting the number
of threads that are available to run on a CPU (i.e. part of the runqueue)
or that are waiting for disk I/O. These figures are averaged over
1 (`avg1'), 5 (`avg5') and 15 (`avg15') minutes.
.br
Furthermore the number of context switches (`csw'), the number
of serviced interrupts (`intr') and the number of available CPUs are shown.

If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters,
only a relevant subset is shown.
.PP
.TP 5
.B GPU
GPU utilization (Nvidia).
.br
Read the section GPU STATISTICS GATHERING in this document to find the details
about the activation of the
.I atopgpud
daemon.

In the first column of every line, the bus-id (last nine characters) and
the GPU number are shown.
The subsequent columns show the percentage of time that one or more kernels
were executing on the GPU (`gpubusy'), the percentage of time that global
(device) memory was being read or written (`membusy'), the occupation
percentage of memory (`memocc'), the total memory (`total'), the memory
being in use at the moment of the sample (`used'), the average memory
being in use during the sample time (`usavg'), the number of processes
being active on the GPU at the moment of the sample (`#proc'), and
the type of GPU.

If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters,
only a relevant subset is shown.
.br
The number of lines showing the GPUs can be limited.
.PP
.TP 5
.B MEM

.br
These lines contain the total amount of physical memory
(`tot'), the amount of memory which is currently free (`free'),
the amount of memory in use as page cache including
the total resident shared memory (`cache'), the amount of memory within the

of memory used for filesystem meta data (`buff'), the amount of
memory being used for kernel mallocs (`slab'), the amount of
slab memory that is reclaimable (`slrec'), the resident size of shared
memory including tmpfs (`shmem'), the resident size of shared memory (`shrss')
the amount of shared memory that is currently swapped (`shswp'),

the amount of huge page memory that is really in use (`hpuse'),
the amount of memory that is used for TCP sockets (`tcps'), and
the amount of memory that is used for UDP sockets (`udps').

.PP
.TP 5
.B SWP
Swap occupation and overcommit info.
.br
This line contains the total amount of swap space on disk (`tot'),

the total size of the memory used for KSM (`ksuse`, i.e. shared), and
the total size of the memory saved (deduped) by KSM (`kssav`, i.e. sharing).
.br
Furthermore the committed virtual memory space (`vmcom') and the maximum 
limit of the committed space (`vmlim', which is by default swap size
plus 50% of memory size) is shown.
The committed space is the reserved virtual space for all allocations of
private memory space for processes. The kernel only verifies whether the
committed space exceeds the limit if strict overcommit handling is
configured (vm.overcommit_memory is 2).
.PP
.TP 5
.B LLC
Last-Level Cache of CPU info.
.br
This line contains the total memory bandwidth of LLC (`tot'),
the bandwidth of the local NUMA node (`loc'), and
the percentage of LLC in use (`LLCXX YY%').

Note that this feature depends on the `resctrl` pseudo filesystem.
Be sure that the kernel is built with the relevant config and
take care that the pseudo-filesystem is mounted:

.B \  mount -t resctrl resctrl -o mba_MBps /sys/fs/resctrl
(on Intel)
.br
.B \  mount -t resctrl resctrl -o cdp \ \ \ \ \ /sys/fs/resctrl

the number of memory pages the system wrote to block devices (`pgout'),
the number of memory pages the system read from swap space (`swin'),
the number of memory pages the system wrote to swap space (`swout'), and
the number of out-of-memory kills (`oomkill').
.PP
.TP 5
.B PSI
Pressure Stall Information.
.br
This line contains percentages about resource pressure related to CPU,
memory and I/O. Certain percentages refer to 'some' meaning that some
processes/threads were delayed due to resource overload. Other
percentages refer to 'full' meaning a loss of overall throughput
due to resource overload.
.br
The values `cpusome', `memsome', `memfull', `iosome' and `iofull'
show the pressure percentage during the entire interval.
.br
The values `cs' (cpu some), `ms' (memory some), `mf' (memory full),
`is' (I/O some) and `if' (I/O full) each show
three percentages separated by slashes:
pressure percentage over the last 10, 60 and 300 seconds.
.PP
.TP 5
.B LVM/MDD/DSK
Logical volume/multiple device/disk utilization.
.br
Per active unit one line is produced, sorted on unit activity.
Such line shows the name (e.g. VolGroup00-lvtmp for a logical volume or
sda for a hard disk), the percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests
were issued to the device (`busy') (note that for devices serving requests in
parallel, such as RAID arrays, SSD and NVMe, this number does not reflect their
performance limits), the number of read requests issued
(`read'), the number of write requests issued (`write'),
the number of discard requests issued (`discrd') if supported by kernel version,

only a relevant subset is shown.

The number of lines showing the units can be limited per class (LVM, MDD or
DSK) with the 'l' key or statically (see separate man-page of atoprc).
By specifying the value 0 for a particular class, no lines will be
shown any more for that class.

For every active network interface one line is shown,
sorted on the interface activity.
Such line shows the name of the interface and its busy percentage

The number of lines showing the Infiniband ports can be limited.
.SH OUTPUT DESCRIPTION - PROCESS LEVEL
Following the system level information, the processes are shown from which the
resource utilization has changed during the last interval. These processes
might have used cpu time or issued disk or network requests. However a process
is also shown if part of it has been paged out due to lack of memory (while
the process itself was in sleep state).

This information will only be shown when the kernel module `netatop'
is loaded.
.PP
.TP 9
.B BANDWO
Total bandwidth for sent TCP and UDP packets consumed by this process

.B POLI
The policies 'norm' (normal, which is SCHED_OTHER), 'btch' (batch)

The policies 'fifo' (SCHED_FIFO) and 'rr' (round robin, which is SCHED_RR)
refer to realtime processes.
.PP
.TP 9

Parent process-id.
If a process has been started and finished during the last

the standard process accounting record.
.PP
.TP 9
.B PRI
The process' priority ranges from 0 (highest priority) to 139 (lowest
priority). Priority 0 to 99 are used for realtime processes (fixed
priority independent of their behavior) and priority 100 to 139 for
timesharing processes (variable priority depending on their recent
CPU consumption and the nice value).
.PP
.TP 9
.B PSIZE
The proportional memory size of this process (or user).
.br
Every process shares resident memory with other processes. E.g. when a
particular program is started several times, the code pages (text) are
only loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations. Also the code
of shared libraries is shared by all processes using that shared library,
as well as shared memory and memory-mapped files.
For the PSIZE calculation of a process, the resident memory of a process
that is shared with other processes is divided by the number of sharers.
This means, that every process is accounted for a proportional part of
that memory. Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the
system gives a reliable impression of the total resident memory consumed
by all processes.
.br
Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is a
very time-consuming task, the 'R' key (or '-R' flag) should
be active. Gathering these values also requires superuser privileges
(otherwise '?K' is shown in the output).
.br
If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is shown
since the proportional memory size is not part of the standard
process accounting record.
.PP
.TP 9
.B RDDSK 
When the kernel maintains standard io statistics (>= 2.6.20):
.br
The read data transfer issued physically on disk (so reading from the
disk cache is not accounted for).
.br
Unfortunately, the kernel aggregates the
data transfer of a process to the data transfer of its parent process when
terminating, so you might see transfers for (parent) processes like
cron, bash or init, that are not really issued by them.
.PP
.TP 9
.B RDELAY
Runqueue delay, i.e. time spent waiting on a runqueue.
.PP
.TP 9
.B RGID
The real group-id under which the process executes. 
.PP
.TP 9
.B RGROW 
The amount of resident memory that the process has grown during the last
interval. A resident growth can be caused by touching memory pages which
were not physically created/loaded before (load-on-demand). 
Note that a resident growth can also be negative e.g. when part of the process
is paged out due to lack of memory or when the process frees dynamically 
allocated memory.
For a process which started during the last interval, the resident growth
reflects the total resident size of the process at that moment.
.br
If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is shown
since resident memory occupation is not part of the standard
process accounting record.
.PP
.TP 9
.B RNET 
The number of TCP- and UDP packets received by this process.
This information will only be shown when kernel module `netatop' is installed.

.B RSIZE
The total resident memory usage consumed by this process (or user).
Notice that the RSIZE of a process includes all resident memory used
by that process, even if certain memory parts are shared with other processes
(see also the explanation of PSIZE).

If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is shown
since resident memory occupation is not part of the standard
process accounting record.
.PP
.TP 9
.B RTPR
Realtime priority according the POSIX standard.

The value
.I E
means 'exit' on the process' own initiative; the exit code is displayed

.B VDATA
The virtual memory size of the private data used by this process
(including heap and shared library data).
.PP
.TP 9
.B VGROW 
The amount of virtual memory that the process has grown during the last
interval. A virtual growth can be caused by e.g. issuing a malloc()
or attaching a shared memory segment. Note that a virtual growth can also
be negative by e.g. issuing a free() or detaching a shared memory segment.
For a process which started during the last interval, the virtual growth
reflects the total virtual size of the process at that moment.
.br
If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is shown
since virtual memory occupation is not part of the standard
process accounting record.
.PP
.TP 9
.B VPID

be active.
.PP
.TP 9
.B WRDSK 
When the kernel maintains standard io statistics (>= 2.6.20):
.br
The write data transfer issued physically on disk (so writing to the
disk cache is not accounted for).
This counter is maintained for the application process that writes its
data to the cache (assuming that this data is physically transferred
to disk later on). Notice that disk I/O needed for swapping is
not taken into account.
.br
Unfortunately, the kernel aggregates the
data transfer of a process to the data transfer of its parent process when
terminating, so you might see transfers for (parent) processes like
cron, bash or init, that are not really issued by them.
.PP
.TP 9
.B WCANCL
When the kernel maintains standard io statistics (>= 2.6.20):
.br
The write data transfer previously accounted for this process
or another process that has been cancelled.
Suppose that a process writes new data to a file and that data is removed
again before the cache buffers have been flushed to disk.
Then the original process shows the written data as WRDSK, while
the process that removes/truncates the file shows
the unflushed removed data as WCANCL.
.SH PARSEABLE OUTPUT
With the flag
.B -P
followed by a list of one or more labels (comma-separated),
parseable output is produced for each sample.
The labels that can be specified for system-level statistics
correspond to the labels (first verb of each line)
that can be found in the interactive output:
"CPU", "cpu", "CPL", "GPU", "MEM", "SWP", "PAG", "PSI", "LVM", "MDD",
"DSK", "NFM", "NFC", "NFS", "NET", "IFB", "LLC", "NUM" and "NUC".

For process-level statistics special labels are available:
"PRG" (general), "PRC" (cpu), "PRE" (GPU), "PRM" (memory), "PRD"
(disk, only if "storage accounting" is active) and "PRN" (network, only if
the kernel module 'netatop' has been installed). 
.br
With the label "ALL", all system and process level statistics are shown.
.PP
The command and command line in the parseable output might contain spaces
and are therefore by default surrounded by parenthesis. However, since
a space is often used as separator between the fields by parsing tools,
with the additional flag
.B -Z
it is possible to exchange the spaces in the command (line) by
underscores and omit the parenthesis.
.PP
For every interval all requested lines are shown whereafter
.B atop
shows a line just containing the label "SEP" as a separator before the
lines for the next sample are generated.

When a sample contains the values since boot,
.B atop
shows a line just containing the label "RESET" before the

.SH SIGNALS
By sending the SIGUSR1 signal to
.I atop
a new sample will be forced, even if the current timer interval
has not exceeded yet. The behavior is similar to pressing the `t` key
in an interactive session.
.PP
By sending the SIGUSR2 signal to
.I atop
a final sample will be forced after which
.I atop
will terminate.
.SH EXAMPLES
To monitor the current system load interactively with an interval of 5 seconds:
.PP
.TP 12
.B \  atop 5
.PP
To monitor the system load and write it to a file (in plain ASCII)
with an interval of one minute during half an hour with active
processes sorted on memory consumption:
.PP
.TP 12
.B \  atop -M 60 30 > /log/atop.mem
.PP
Store information about the system and process activity in binary compressed
form to a file with an interval of ten minutes during an hour:
.PP
.TP 12
.B \  atop -w /tmp/atop.raw 600 6
.PP
View the contents of this file interactively:
.PP
.B \  atop -r /tmp/atop.raw
.PP
View the processor and disk utilization of this file in parseable format:
.PP
.B \  atop -PCPU,DSK -r /tmp/atop.raw
.PP
View the contents of today's standard logfile interactively:
.PP
.B \  atop -r
.PP
View the contents of the standard logfile of the day before yesterday
interactively:
.PP
.B \  atop -r yy
.PP
View the contents of the standard logfile of 2014, June 7 from
02:00 PM onwards interactively:
.PP
.B \  atop -r 20140607 -b 1400
.PP
Concatenate all raw log files of January 2020 and generate parsable
output about the CPU utilization:
.PP
.TP 12
.B \  atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_202001?? | atop -r -  -PCPU

.SH FILES
.PP
.TP 5
.B /var/run/pacct_shadow.d/
Directory containing the process accounting shadow files that are
used by
.I atop
when the
.I atopacctd
daemon is active.
.PP
.TP 5
.B /var/cache/atop.d/atop.acct
File in which the kernel writes the accounting records when
.I atop
itself has activated the process accounting mechanism.
.PP
.TP 5
.B /etc/atoprc
Configuration file containing system-wide default values.
See related man-page.
.PP
.TP 5
.B ~/.atoprc
Configuration file containing personal default values.
See related man-page.
.PP
.TP 5
.B /etc/default/atop
Configuration file to overrule the settings of
.I atop
that runs in the background to create the daily logfile.
This file is created when
.I atop
is installed.
The default settings are:
.TP 8
\
.br
LOGOPTS=""

.BI /var/log/atop/atop_ YYYYMMDD
Raw file, where
.I YYYYMMDD
are digits representing the current date.
This name is used by
.B atop 
running in the background as default name for the output file, and by
.B atop
as default name for the input file when using the
.B -r
flag.
.br
All binary system and process level data in this file has been stored
in compressed format. 
.PP
.TP 5
.BI /var/run/netatop.log
File that contains the netpertask structs containing the network
counters of exited processes. These structs are written by the
.I netatopd
daemon and read by
.I atop
after reading the standard process accounting records.
